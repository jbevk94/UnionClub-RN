            Founded in 1888, the Union Club served as a social and business club
            for the most influential men of the time. In 1906, a three-story
            addition was designed to give women access to the Union Club. In
            1936, the University Union Club was founded and remained in the
            building until 1985.

            Designated guests of the Union Club include President William Taft,
            First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and college football coach Knute
            Rockne.

            In 2016, the Union Club was in a state of disrepair and was
            purchased by Amber and Eli Moreno. With a passion for historical
            preservation they have restored the building back to its original
            grandeur and have created a new, modern take on the Union Club.
